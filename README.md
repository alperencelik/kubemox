# Kubemox

Kubemox is a Proxmox operator for Kubernetes. It allows you to create and manage Proxmox VMs from Kubernetes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with version 1.16+
- Helm 3+
- Proxmox Cluster with version 6.3+

### Install Kubemox with Helm

To install Kubemox you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alperencelik/kubemox.git
cd kubemox/charts/kubemox
# Edit values.yaml file (Proxmox credentials, etc.)
vim values.yaml
helm install kubemox ./ -f values.yaml -n $NAMESPACE
```

## Usage

Currently Kubemox brings five different CRDs for only VirtualMachines in Proxmox. These are `VirtualMachine`, `VirtualMachineSet`, `ManagedVirtualMachine`, `VirtualMachineSnapshot` and `VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy`. You can use these CRDs to create and manage VirtualMachine(s) in Proxmox. 

### VirtualMachine

`VirtualMachine` is a way to create new VirtualMachines in Proxmox via operator. You can create `VirtualMachine` resource and Kubemox will create it for you in Proxmox. `VirtualMachine` is also reconciled by the operator which means every change on `VirtualMachine` resource will be reflected to Proxmox as well. 

`VirtualMachineSet` is a way to create multiple VirtualMachines in Proxmox. The relationship between `VirtualMachineSet` and `VirtualMachine` is similar to the relationship between `Deployment` and `Pod`. `VirtualMachineSet` creates multiple `VirtualMachine` resources and Kubemox will create them for you in Proxmox. You can only use `VirtualMachineSet` with templates. Creating multiple VirtualMachines from scratch is not supported yet. 

`ManagedVirtualMachine` is a way to bring your existing VirtualMachines in Proxmox to Kubernetes. As an user you don't need to create `ManagedVirtualMachine` resource. Kubemox will create it for you after the deployment at startup of controller. `ManagedVirtualMachine` is also reconciled by the operator so if you do any change on those (delete, update, etc.) it will be reflected to Proxmox. 

`VirtualMachineSnapshot` is helping to create snapshots for `VirtualMachine` object. This object mostly considered for the milestone snapshots. This will create only one snapshot for the `VirtualMachine` object. Also deleting the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object won't be deleting the snapshot from Proxmox since the current proxmox client the project uses doesn't have an implementation for deleting snapshots.

`VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy` is helping to create snapshots for `VirtualMachine` object periodically. This object mostly considered for the scheduled snapshots. The schedule and the selectors that you specify matches with the `VirtualMachine` objects and according to the schedule it will create snapshots for those `VirtualMachine` objects. `VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy` will be spawning `VirtualMachineSnapshot` objects for each `VirtualMachine` object that matches with the selectors. Also deleting the `VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy` object also won't be deleting the snapshots from Proxmox but it will stop creating new `VirtualMachineSnapshot` objects for the `VirtualMachine` objects that matches with the selectors.

### Containers

`Container` is a way to create new Linux containers (LXC) in Proxmox via operator. You can create `Container` resource and Kubemox will create it for you in Proxmox. `Container` is also reconciled by the operator which means every change on `Container` resource will be reflected to Proxmox as well. `Container` object should be generated by other container template objects. This is a requirement that comes from Proxmox itself.

### Create a VirtualMachine

To create a VirtualMachine you can use the following `VirtualMachine` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: proxmox.alperen.cloud/v1alpha1 
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: test-vm
spec:
  name: test-vm
  nodeName: proxmox-node
  template:
    name: ubuntu-20.04-cloudinit-template
    cores: 4
    sockets: 1
    memory: 4096
    disk:
      - size: 50G
        storage: local-lvm
        type: scsi
    network:
      - model: virtio
        bridge: vmbr0
```
### Create a VirtualMachineSet

To create a VirtualMachineSet you can use the following `VirtualMachineSet` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: proxmox.alperen.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachineSet
metadata:
  name: test-vmset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  nodeName: lowtower
  template:
    name: ubuntu-20.04-cloudinit-template
    cores: 4
    sockets: 1
    memory: 4096
    disk:
      - size: 50G
        storage: local-lvm
        type: scsi
    network:
      - model: virtio
        bridge: vmbr0
```


### Create a VirtualMachineSnapshot

To create a VirtualMachineSnapshot you can use the following `VirtualMachineSnapshot` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: proxmox.alperen.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachineSnapshot
metadata:
  name: test-vm-snapshot
spec:
  vmName: test-vm
  # snapshotName is optional ( if you don't specify it will create a snapshot with the current date )
  snapshotName: test-vm-snapshot
```

### Create a VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy

To create a VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy you can use the following `VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: proxmox.alperen.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachineSnapshotPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-vm-snapshot-policy
spec:
  schedule: "*/30 * * * *" # Create a snapshot every 30 minutes
  namespaceSelector: ["my-namespace"]
    matchLabels:
      my-label: my-virtualmachine
```

### Create a Container

To create a Container you can use the following `Container` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: proxmox.alperen.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Container
metadata:
  name: container-new
spec:
  name: container-new
  nodeName: lowtower
  template:
    # This template should be generated by other container template object
    name: test-container 
    cores: 2
    memory: 4096 # As MB
    disk: 
      - storage: nvme 
        size: 50 # As GB
        type: scsi
    network:
      - model: virtio
        bridge: vmbr0
```

## Developing 

You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster. The project is using [Kubebuilder](book.kubebuilder.io) to generate the controller and CRDs. For Proxmox interaction the project is using [go-proxmox](https://github.com/luthermonson/go-proxmox) project. The controllers are located under `internal/controllers/proxmox` directory and the external packages `proxmox` and `kubernetes` are located under `pkg` directory.

- To create a new controller you can use the following command:

```bash
kubebuilder create api --group proxmox --version v1alpha1 --kind NewKind 
```

- Define the spec and status of your new kind in `api/proxmox/v1alpha1/newkind_types.go` file.

- Define the controller logic in `internal/controllers/proxmox/newkind_controller.go` file.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Add more CRDs for Proxmox resources (LXC(Containers), Storage, Networking etc.)
- [ ] Add more options for Proxmox client (TLS and different authentication methods)
- [ ] Add more features to the operator (HA, configuration, etc.)
- [ ] Add metrics for the operator
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Add more examples
