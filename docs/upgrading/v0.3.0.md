# Upgrade to v0.3.0

This guide is suitable for upgrading Kubemox from versions <0.3.0 to v0.3.X.

## Breaking Changes

- The `kubemox` has moved most of their CRDs from `Namespace` scope to `Cluster` scope. This means that most of the CRDs are now cluster-wide resources.

## Upgrade Steps

* Backup your Kubemox resources.

* Stop the operator by scaling down the operator deployment to 0 replicas.

```shell
    kubectl scale deployment kubemox --replicas=0 
```

* Delete the Kubemox Custom Resources and Custom Resource Definitions. Before doing that make sure that there is no Kubemox controller running on the cluster. You might need to delete finalizers on the object manually to complete the deletion.

* Now you can upgrade the operator to the new version by applying the helm chart.

```shell
    helm upgrade kubemox /path/to/kubemox/helm/chart 
```

* Restore your Kubemox resources.

* Start the operator by scaling up the operator deployment to 1 replica.

```shell
    kubectl scale deployment kubemox --replicas=1
```

* Verify that the operator is running and the Kubemox resources are in the desired state.

## Additional Notes

- For making the breaking changes smoother in the future, Kubemox has adopted the Reconcile Modes for the Custom Resources starting from v0.3.0. This will make the upgrade process easier and less error-prone. For more information, please refer to the [Reconcile Modes](../reconciliation-modes.md) documentation.
