# Roadmap

The project is aiming to support most of the Proxmox features. The project is still in early development phase and there are lots of things to do. The testing part is totally missing and the project doesn't have so much known coverage. The aim of the Project is having declarative Proxmox management via Kubernetes CRDs and covering the Proxmox API as much as possible.


- [ ] Add more CRDs for Proxmox resources (LXC(Containers), Storage, Networking etc.)
- [x] Add more options for Proxmox client (TLS and different authentication methods)
- [ ] Add more features to the operator (HA, configuration, etc.)
- [ ] Add metrics for the operator
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Add more examples
