# Container 

`Container` is a way to create new Linux containers (LXC) in Proxmox via operator. You can create `Container` resource and Kubemox will create it for you in Proxmox. `Container` is also reconciled by the operator which means every change on `Container` resource will be reflected to Proxmox as well. `Container` object should be generated by other container template objects. This is a requirement that comes from Proxmox itself.
