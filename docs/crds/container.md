# Container 

`Container` is a way to create new Linux containers (LXC) in Proxmox via operator. You can create `Container` resource and Kubemox will create it for you in Proxmox. `Container` is also reconciled by the operator which means every change on `Container` resource will be reflected to Proxmox as well. `Container` object should be generated by other container template objects. This is a requirement that comes from Proxmox itself.


## Creating Container

To create a new container in Proxmox, you need to create a `Container` object. This object should be generated by other container template objects.

```yaml
apiVersion: proxmox.alperen.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Container
metadata:
  name: container-new
spec:
  connectionRef:
    name: proxmox-connection-sample
  name: container-new
  nodeName: lowtower
  # Deletion protection is whether to delete VM from Proxmox or not
  deleteProtection: false
  # VM should be started any time found in stopped state
  enableAutostart: true
  template:
    # Name of the template to be cloned
    name: test-container 
    cores: 2
    memory: 4096 # As MB
    disk: 
      - storage: nvme 
        size: 50 # As GB
        type: scsi
    network:
      - model: virtio
        bridge: vmbr0
```
