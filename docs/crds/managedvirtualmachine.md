# ManagedVirtualMachine

`ManagedVirtualMachine` is a way to bring your existing VirtualMachines in Proxmox to Kubernetes. As an user you don't need to create `ManagedVirtualMachine` resource. Kubemox will create it for you after the deployment at startup of controller. `ManagedVirtualMachine` is also reconciled by the operator so if you do any change on those (delete, update, etc.) it will be reflected to Proxmox.
