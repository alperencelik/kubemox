# VirtualMachine

`VirtualMachine` is a way to create new VirtualMachines in Proxmox via operator. You can create `VirtualMachine` resource and Kubemox will create it for you in Proxmox. `VirtualMachine` is also reconciled by the operator which means every change on `VirtualMachine` resource will be reflected to Proxmox as well.
